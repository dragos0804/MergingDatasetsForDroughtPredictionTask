<h1>Abstract</h1>
This study introduces a novel approach to drought prediction in Eastern and Central Europe by combining IoT soil moisture sensor data with freely available datasets. It integrates real-time IoT soil moisture measurements, SOTER-based soil parameters (SOTWIS), and NASA POWER environmental data. The methodology includes data preprocessing, spatial clustering using DBSCAN, and a machine learning framework combining Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM networks. The research highlights how incorporating soil texture data with climatic variables enhances drought prediction accuracy. It also presents an Arduino-based IoT prototype for continuous soil monitoring, addressing the benefits and challenges of IoT in agriculture. This approach offers improved drought prediction and supports better agricultural decision-making in under-researched regions.
